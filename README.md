# SageRank

SageRank is a tool for keeping track of the papers you read, and perhaps more importantly, for
helping you find papers that can help you understand those you're interested in. Upon adding papers
that you've read or that are on your to-read list to SageRank, it builds a graph of these papers and
those in their bibliographies. SageRank can then recommend relevant articles to you using an
algorithm similar to Google's PageRank.
